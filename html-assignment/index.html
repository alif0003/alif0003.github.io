    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born on July 4<sup>th</sup> in Venezuela and I have always been connected to the sea and water sports like swimming and surfing. On weekends I used to go surfing in <em>La Guaira</em>, near Caracas. My interest in art runs in my family: my father was a goldsmith and my brother is an actor. Since I was a child, I have been passionate about photography, a world I discovered when my father gave me my first camera.</p>
    <p>Although I have been involved in art since I was a child, it wasn't until I was 26 years old that I decided to study filmmaking, after almost four years studying history. After graduating, my brother suggested I move to Canada. Now I'm here, studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, facing new challenges and exciting learning.</p>
